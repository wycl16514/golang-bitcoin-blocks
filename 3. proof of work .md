When miners broadcast a block on to the chain,it needs to pay some cost for it, the cost is to prevent adversive node try to create fake
transactions and group them in a block and add the the chain. This is like when ganster want to accept a member, the boss will ask the guy
to commit some crime like killing somebody, by doing this can prevent the guy beging an undercover of the police.

the miners need to do some heavy computation, when it has the result, other miners can easily verify the result, and then the given miner will allow to put its block on to the chain.

Let's see the details of proof-of-work, in previous section, we compute the hash256 of the given block header and has the following result:
```go
0000000000000000007e9e4c586439b0cdbe13b1370bdd9435d76a644d047523
```
We can see there are several zeros at the beginning of the hash result. Since the result of hash256 is very random, therefore given any bit in the result, the probability that it takes
the value of zero is 0.5, a zero in the aboved result needs 4 bits to represent, which means a 0 happenning at the result has probability of 0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5.The probability of more zerosappear in the result will decrease dramatically. As there are 18 zeros appear at the beginning of the result then its probability is (0.5)^(4*18) which is roughly 10^22. 

If one want to get the same result above, it needs to do 10^22 rounds of computation which is a huge computation task. There is a concept 
called difficulty in bitcoin mining, which is how many zeros need to appear at the beginning of block header hash, when the difficulty 
increase, the more zeros need to appear at the beginning of the hash.

The question is how to make given number of zeros appear at the beginning of hash? This is where the nonce comes in. The miner can manipulate
this field to generate the hash to meet the requirement. Since there are 4 bytes for the nonce field 
which means the miner can try 2^32 times to get the required hash.

The number of zeros that are required at the beginning of the hash is determinted by the value computed from the bits field. The computed 
value has name of "target", as long as the hash result smaller than the target, then it will guarantee there are enough zeros at the 
beginning of the hash256 result.

In order to compute the target, we need to sperate the bits filed into two parts, since it has 4 bytes, then we seperate it to two parts by
using the last byte as the first part which is called exponent, and the last three bytes is another part call coefficient, then the value of
target is :

target = coefficient * 256^(exponent - 3)

We need to get more explaination for aboved equation. The bits field in the block header is used to encode a kind of hex value that are only
three no zero digits at the left and lots of zero on the right such as the following value:
```go
0000000000000000013ce9000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
We can see that there are only three no zero bytes which are 0x01, 0x3c , 0xe9, and there are dosens of zeros at the right. We can encode 
such value by using four bytes, we can use threee bytes to encode the three no zeros bytes, and the last byte can used to record the total
number of bytes in the value.

Notices that two digit conrresponding to one byte, therefore the value of 0x013ce9000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 has 0x18 which
is 24 bytes in total, then we can encode the aboved value in four bytes as following:

18 01 3c e9

if we want to get the value from above encoding, we can first take the last three bytes and assembly them into hex value of 0x013ce9,
then we need to left shift this value with 0x15 bytes, each byte has 8 bits, which means we need to do is:
      0x013ce9 << 8 * 0x15

since a value shift left one bit is like the value multiple the value of 2, therefore the equation above is equivalent to:

      0x013ce9 * 2^(8*15) => 0x013c39 * (2^8)^(15) => 0x013ce9 * 256^(0x15) => 0x013ce9 * 256^(0x18-3)

And notices that if we reverse the byte order of 18 01 3c e9, then we get e9 3c 01 18 this is exactly the the value of bits field in our
block header.


We will use the following code to compute the target:
```go
func (b *Block) Target() *big.Int {
	//exponent - 3
	var opSub big.Int
	exponentPart := opSub.Sub(big.NewInt(int64(b.bits[len(b.bits)-1])), big.NewInt(int64(3)))
	//the most significant three bits is coefficient
	coefficientBuf := b.bits[0 : len(b.bits)-1]
	coefficientBytes := reverseByteSlice(coefficientBuf)
	coefficient := new(big.Int)
	coefficient.SetBytes(coefficientBytes)
	var opPow big.Int
	var opMul big.Int
	exponent := opPow.Exp(big.NewInt(int64(256)), exponentPart, nil)
	result := opMul.Mul(coefficient, exponent)
	return result
}
```
Then we can run the code in main.go as following:
```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
	tx "transaction"
)

func main() {
blockRawData, err := hex.DecodeString("020000208ec39428b17323fa0ddec8e887b4a7c53b8c0a0a220cfd0000000000000000005b0750fce0a889502d40508d39576821155e9c9e3f5c3157f961db38fd8b25be1e77a759e93c0118a4ffd71d")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	block := tx.ParseBlock(blockRawData)

	fmt.Printf("target value: %064x\n", block.Target())
}

```
Running aboved code will get the following result:
```go
target value: 0000000000000000013ce9000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
If you compare the aboved value with the hash result of the block header:
```go
0000000000000000007e9e4c586439b0cdbe13b1370bdd9435d76a644d047523
```
We can easily check that the hash result is smaller than the target value. It is inhuman to ask human to compare two huge values such as two
values aboved. In order for human to known how hard it is to compute the right hash, the concept of difficulty was born. The difficulty is
computed by the following way:

difficulty = 0xffff * s56^(0x1d-3) / target

We can use the following code to compute the difficulty:
```go
func (b *Block) Difficulty() *big.Int {
	target := b.Target()
	var opMul big.Int
	var opExp big.Int
	var opDiv big.Int
	numerator := opMul.Mul(big.NewInt(0xffff), opExp.Exp(big.NewInt(256), big.NewInt(0x1d-3), nil))
	denominator := target
	difficulty := opDiv.Div(numerator, denominator)
	return difficulty
}
```
Then we can call the method aboved in main.go:
```go
func main() {
    ....
    fmt.Printf("difficulty: %d\n", block.Difficulty().Int64())
}
```
The result for the aboved code is :
```go
difficulty: 888171856257
```
If we set the difficulty of the first block is 1, then the value aboved means if you want to earn a bitcoin as a miner, you need to try
888 billion times harder than when the time when bitcoin was created!

In bitcoin, each group of 2016 blocks is called a difficulty adjustment period. Which means when every 2016 blocks are created and append
to the chain, the value of difficulty will adjus again by using the following method:

time_differential = (time stamp of the last block in the current group) - (time stamp of first block in the current group) / 
(2 weeks in seconds)

if time_differential > (2 weeks in seconds) * 4, time_differential = (2 weeks in seconds) * 4

if time_differential < (2 weeks in seconds) // 4, time_differential = (2 weeks in seconds) // 4

new_target = previous_target * time_differential // (2 weeks)

We can use the following cde to implement the method aboved:
```go
const (
	TWO_WEEKS = 60 * 60 * 24 * 14
)

func ComputeNewBits(firstBlockBytes []byte, lastBlockBytes []byte) *big.Int {
	firstBlock := ParseBlock(firstBlockBytes)
	lastBlock := ParseBlock(lastBlockBytes)

	firstBlockTime := new(big.Int)
	firstBlockTime.SetBytes(firstBlock.timeStamp)
	lastBlockTime := new(big.Int)
	lastBlockTime.SetBytes(lastBlock.timeStamp)

	var opSub big.Int
	timeDifferential := opSub.Sub(lastBlockTime, firstBlockTime)
	if timeDifferential.Cmp(big.NewInt(TWO_WEEKS*4)) > 0 {
		timeDifferential = big.NewInt(TWO_WEEKS * 4)
	}
	if timeDifferential.Cmp(big.NewInt(TWO_WEEKS/4)) < 0 {
		timeDifferential = big.NewInt(TWO_WEEKS / 4)
	}

	var opMul big.Int
	var opDiv big.Int
	newTarget := opDiv.Div(opMul.Mul(lastBlock.Target(), timeDifferential), big.NewInt(TWO_WEEKS))
	return newTarget
}
```
Then we can test the code in main.go by following code:
```go
lastBlockRawData, err := hex.DecodeString("00000020fdf740b0e49cf75bb3d5168fb3586f7613dcc5cd89675b0100000000000000002e37b144c0baced07eb7e7b64da916cd3121f2427005551aeb0ec6a6402ac7d7f0e4235954d801187f5da9f5")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	firstBlockRawData, err := hex.DecodeString("000000201ecd89664fd205a37566e694269ed76e425803003628ab010000000000000000bfcade29d080d9aae8fd461254b041805ae442749f2a40100440fc0e3d5868e55019345954d80118a1721b2e")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	newTarget := tx.ComputeNewBits(firstBlockRawData, lastBlockRawData)
	fmt.Printf("new target: %064x\n", newTarget.Bytes())
```
Running the aboved code will give the following result:
```go
new target: 0000000000000000007615000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Finaly let's see how given the target value, how can we convert it the the bits field of block header

```go
func TargetToBits(target *big.Int) []byte {
	targetBytes := target.Bytes()
	exponent := len(targetBytes)
	coefficient := targetBytes[0:3]
	bits := make([]byte, 0)
	bits = append(bits, reverseByteSlice(coefficient)...)
	bits = append(bits, byte(exponent))
	return bits
}
```
If we use the aboved function to convert the new target value into bits, we will use the code as following:
```go
newTarget := tx.ComputeNewBits(firstBlockRawData, lastBlockRawData)
fmt.Printf("new target: %064x\n", newTarget.Bytes())
newBits := tx.TargetToBits(newTarget)
fmt.Printf("new bits:%x\n", newBits)
```
Then the output for aboved code is:
```go
new target: 0000000000000000007615000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
new bits:00157617
```
