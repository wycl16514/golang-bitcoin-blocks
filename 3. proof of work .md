When miners broadcast a block on to the chain, it needs some mechanism to prevent miner attach fake block on to the public chain. The proof-of-work is a heavy computation task, the miners
need to do some heavy computation, when it has the result, other miners can easily verify the result, and then the given miner will allow to put its block on to the chain.

Let's see the details of proof-of-work, in previous section, we compute the hash256 of the given block header and has the following result:
```go
0000000000000000007e9e4c586439b0cdbe13b1370bdd9435d76a644d047523
```
We can see there are several zeros at the beginning of the hash result. Since the result of hash256 is very random, therefore given any bit in the result, the probability that it takes
the value of zero is 0.5, a zero in the aboved result needs 4 bits to represent, which means a 0 happenning at the result has probability of 0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5.The probability of more zeros
appear in the result will decrease dramatically. As there are 18 zeros appear at the beginning of the result then its probability is (0.5)^(4*18) which is roughly 10^22. 
If one want to get the same result above, it needs to do 10^22 rounds of computation which is a huge computation task.
