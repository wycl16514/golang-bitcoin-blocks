When miners broadcast a block on to the chain,it needs to pay some cost for it, the cost is to prevent adversive node try to create fake
transactions and group them in a block and add the the chain. This is like when ganster want to accept a member, the boss will ask the guy
to commit some crime like killing somebody, by doing this can prevent the guy beging an undercover of the police.

the miners need to do some heavy computation, when it has the result, other miners can easily verify the result, and then the given miner will allow to put its block on to the chain.

Let's see the details of proof-of-work, in previous section, we compute the hash256 of the given block header and has the following result:
```go
0000000000000000007e9e4c586439b0cdbe13b1370bdd9435d76a644d047523
```
We can see there are several zeros at the beginning of the hash result. Since the result of hash256 is very random, therefore given any bit in the result, the probability that it takes
the value of zero is 0.5, a zero in the aboved result needs 4 bits to represent, which means a 0 happenning at the result has probability of 0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5.The probability of more zerosappear in the result will decrease dramatically. As there are 18 zeros appear at the beginning of the result then its probability is (0.5)^(4*18) which is roughly 10^22. 

If one want to get the same result above, it needs to do 10^22 rounds of computation which is a huge computation task. There is a concept 
called difficulty in bitcoin mining, which is how many zeros need to appear at the beginning of block header hash, when the difficulty 
increase, the more zeros need to appear at the beginning of the hash.

The question is how to make given number of zeros appear at the beginning of hash? This is where the nonce comes in. The miner can manipulate
this field to generate the hash to meet the requirement. Since there are 4 bytes for the nonce field which means the miner can try 2^32 times
to get the required hash.

The number of zeros that are required at the beginning of the hash is determinted by the value computed from the bits field. The computed 
value has name of "target", as long as the hash result smaller than the target, then it will guarantee there are enough zeros at the 
beginning of the hash256 result.

In order to compute the target, we need to sperate the bits filed into two parts, since it has 4 bytes, then we seperate it to two parts by
using the last byte as the first part which is called exponent, and the last three bytes is another part call coefficient, then the value of
target is :

target = coefficient * 256^(exponent - 3)

We will use the following code to compute the target:
```go
func (b *Block) Target() *big.Int {
	//exponent - 3
	var opSub big.Int
	exponentPart := opSub.Sub(big.NewInt(int64(b.bits[len(b.bits)-1])), big.NewInt(int64(3)))
	//the most significant three bits is coefficient
	coefficientBuf := b.bits[0 : len(b.bits)-1]
	coefficientBytes := reverseByteSlice(coefficientBuf)
	coefficient := new(big.Int)
	coefficient.SetBytes(coefficientBytes)
	var opPow big.Int
	var opMul big.Int
	exponent := opPow.Exp(big.NewInt(int64(256)), exponentPart, nil)
	result := opMul.Mul(coefficient, exponent)
	return result
}
```
Then we can run the code in main.go as following:
```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
	tx "transaction"
)

func main() {
blockRawData, err := hex.DecodeString("020000208ec39428b17323fa0ddec8e887b4a7c53b8c0a0a220cfd0000000000000000005b0750fce0a889502d40508d39576821155e9c9e3f5c3157f961db38fd8b25be1e77a759e93c0118a4ffd71d")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	block := tx.ParseBlock(blockRawData)

	fmt.Printf("target value: %064x\n", block.Target())
}

```
Running aboved code will get the following result:
```go
target value: 0000000000000000013ce9000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
If you compare the aboved value with the hash result of the block header:
```go
0000000000000000007e9e4c586439b0cdbe13b1370bdd9435d76a644d047523
```
We can easily check that the hash result is smaller than the target value. It is inhuman to ask human to compare two huge values such as two
values aboved. In order for human to known how hard it is to compute the right hash, the concept of difficulty was born. The difficulty is
computed by the following way:

difficulty = 0xffff * s56^(0x1d-3) / target

We can use the following code to compute the difficulty:
```go
func (b *Block) Difficulty() *big.Int {
	target := b.Target()
	var opMul big.Int
	var opExp big.Int
	var opDiv big.Int
	numerator := opMul.Mul(big.NewInt(0xffff), opExp.Exp(big.NewInt(256), big.NewInt(0x1d-3), nil))
	denominator := target
	difficulty := opDiv.Div(numerator, denominator)
	return difficulty
}
```
Then we can call the method aboved in main.go:
```go
func main() {
    ....
    fmt.Printf("difficulty: %d\n", block.Difficulty().Int64())
}
```
The result for the aboved code is :
```go
difficulty: 888171856257
```
If we set the difficulty of the first block is 1, then the value aboved means if you want to earn a bitcoin as a miner, you need to try
888 billion times harder than when the time when bitcoin was created!

In bitcoin, each group of 2016 blocks is called a difficulty adjustment period. Which means when every 2016 blocks are created and append
to the chain, the value of difficulty will adjus again by using the following method:

time_differential = (time stamp of the last block in the current group) - (time stamp of first block in the current group) / (2 weeks)
new_target = previous_target * time_differential / (2 weeks)

We can use the following cde to implement the method aboved:
```go

```
